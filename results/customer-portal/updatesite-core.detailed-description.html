This release .zip file can be used to install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio features into your existing Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 10 or ${eclipse.version} installation. 

The IDE can install these features directly from an online update site but this file provides you with an alternative to the update site in the case that you want to work offline. 

The release .zip file was built with ${eclipse.version} but it should also work with future Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) versions.
